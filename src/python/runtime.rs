//! The shared tokio runtime backing all sessions.
//!
//! A single process-wide runtime keeps task spawning cheap and
//! avoids interpreter-shutdown deadlocks: per-session runtimes would
//! have to be joined during `Drop`, which cannot block on tasks that
//! need the GIL while Python is finalizing.
//!
//! The runtime must not outlive the interpreter: a worker thread
//! that still holds a Python thread state at `PyInterpreterState_Delete`
//! time aborts the process ("remaining threads").  [`shutdown`]
//! therefore tears the runtime down from an `atexit` hook, which
//! CPython runs before interpreter finalization.
