"""Golden-file harness: listings captured once, compared forever.

A golden test runs a deterministic scenario (a session against a
firmware emulator), records the traffic, and compares the decoded
listing against a committed fixture.  Captures from real hardware
can be dropped in as fixtures the same way: replay them here and
protocol changes that alter the wire behavior fail loudly.

Fixtures are two files per scenario: ``<name>.listing`` (the
compared, timestamp-free listing) and ``<name>.jsonl`` (the full
capture with timings, for humans and for replay).  Regenerate or
create them with ``RAYDRIVER_REGEN_GOLDEN=1``.
