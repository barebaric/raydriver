"""Paced replay of captured host-to-device frames.

Replay sends every ``tx`` frame of a capture to a live connection
with the recorded pacing, so a controller sees (a sped-up version
of) the original conversation.  This drives characterization: edit
a capture's JSONL, replay it against real hardware, and capture
the responses.

Frames are written through an async ``write`` callable, which
keeps this module independent of the transport: today that is a
TCP connection (see the CLI's ``analyzer replay`` command); once
raw transports are exposed to Python it works for serial too.
