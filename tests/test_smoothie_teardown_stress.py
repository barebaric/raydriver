"""Stress the Smoothie cancel/teardown path.

Reproduces the churn that preceded the intermittent Windows access
violation: many connect/run/cancel/disconnect/drop cycles with GC,
including dropping a session without an explicit disconnect so the
last session reference is released from a tokio worker. Guards the
teardown path against regressions; the runtime's GIL watchdog is
opt-in (RAYDRIVER_GIL_WATCHDOG) so it does not perturb these runs.
